# Practical example 5: Exceptional mathematics (cont.)

Why is it important that we be sure what exceptions we expect to see raised
from our code?

Exceptions are part of the public interface that a module provides.

If strange exceptions are thrown, consumers of the module will have to deal
with it.

If the specific type of exception thrown by a function changes, that is a
change to your public interface. It could even be a breaking change.

For example, when I try to use a dictionary key that doesn't exist, I get a
`KeyError`. If that ever changes, every piece of code that checks for a
`KeyError` in that situation will break.

Your own code should make similar guarantees, and it should provide a stable
interface for its exceptions.
