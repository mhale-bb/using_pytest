# Practical example 1: Starting from scratch (cont.)

Now that we know what a failing test looks like, let's make it pass:

```python tests/test_foo.py
def test_math_works():
    x = 1
    y = 1
    assert x + y == 2
```

Our first example is directly executing the code that it's testing. Normally
though, we want to test the code that's actually defined in our module.
