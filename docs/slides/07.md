# Practical example 2: Testing code in our module

We still haven't decided what this module should be doing. For this talk, we'll
have it perform some simple math operations.

This is the point at which you are required to think about the public interface
of your module. How do you want users to consume this code? Since this is
supposed to be doing math, maybe it should expose some mathy functions?

```python tests/test_using_pytest.py
import using_pytest

def test_add():
    x = 1
    y = 2
    assert using_pytest.add(x, y) == 3

def test_multiply():
    x = 4
    y = 6
    assert using_pytest.multiply(x, y) == 24
```
