# Test fixtures

`pytest` provides a method of supplying tests with necessary input, called
"fixtures." These are decorated functions that are passed into tests via
parameters of the same name.

If a test accepts a parameter with the same name as a fixture, the test will
receive the results of calling that fixture.

Fixtures are extremely flexible:

* Fixtures can depend on other fixtures
* Fixtures can be scoped as necessary
* Tests can use more than one fixture at a time
* Fixtures can be reused, facilitating test isolation
