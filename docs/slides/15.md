# Practical example 5: Exceptional mathematics

Let's say we call our math functions with non-number input. What should our
code do?

Well, given the functions require numbers to work, we should probably raise a
`TypeError` if arguments of the wrong type are passed as input:

```python tests/test_using_pytest
# ... eariler file content elided ...

def test_add_non_numbers():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        using_pytest.add("non", "numbers")

def test_multiply_non_numbers():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError):
        using_pytest.multiply("non", "numbers")
```
