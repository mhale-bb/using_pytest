# Why test?

As used in this talk, when I say "test," I am using the following definitions:

**test:**

1. _(verb):_ the act of verifying the expected functionality of a system using
             automated tools.
2. _(noun):_ an automated tool that verifies an expectation of a system.

Tests answer the fundamental question: does this system do what I expect it to
do, given the inputs provided?

This question is always present when working with a system, whether it is written down or it lives in your head.

Testing, as a practice, simply takes this question and codifies it into a
program.
