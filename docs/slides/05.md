# Practical example 1: Starting from scratch

We're starting with a brand new project, and the `tests` directory is noticably
empty.

We'll make our first test file in the `tests` directory, called `test_foo.py`.

To demonstrate `pytest`, we'll add a simple test in `test_foo.py`:

```python tests/test_foo.py
def test_math_works():
    x = 1
    y = 1
    assert x + y == 1 # This will fail
```

Note that this test doesn't need to import anything from `pytest`. It's just
regular Python code, with a regular `assert` statement.

The names of your tests don't matter until you know what it is you're testing.
At the beginning, they can be any nonsense phrase. You can always squash your
commits later.
