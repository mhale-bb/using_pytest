# Test files and tests

Test files look like `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, and `pytest` is configured by
default to find all such files in your project's test directory (`tests`, in
this case).

Each test in a test file is a function or method prefixed with `test`. Methods
can also be grouped into classes prefixed with `Test`. `pytest` will execute
each test it finds in each test file, and display the results.

For example:

```python test_stuff.py
def test_something():
    ...
```
