# Practical example 2: Testing code in our module (cont.)

Note some of the things that these tests are describing:

* Our module provides functions `add()` and `multiply()`
* These functions each take at least 2 positional parameters
* We expect them to return results appropriate to the arguments provided

These are some of the module's requirements that need to be tested, but these
tests are not exhaustive. Think about some other requirements that we could
include in our tests:

* What happens if we call `add()` or `multiply()` with non-number arguments?
* Can we call them with just one argument? Three or more? Only two?
* Can they handle negative numbers?

All of these questions are about the public interface of the module, and should
be answered with tests.
