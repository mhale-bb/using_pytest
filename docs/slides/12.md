# Parameterization

Just like normal code, test code can be refactored to deduplicate test logic.
Instead of running dozens of copies of effectively the same test, we can
define a test to operate on parameters passed at runtime.

`pytest` provides two main interfaces for parameterizing tests:

* Parameterized fixtures
* The `pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator

While either can be used to parameterize a test, they work a bit differently:

* A parameterized fixture will automatically re-run any tests which depend on
  it, providing them a different parameter each time. The tests don't need to
  encode the knowledge that they will be re-run.
* Tests decorated with `pytest.mark.parametrize` will automatically execute
  once for each parameter, passing in the parameters as-is.

In general:

* Use parameterized fixtures when the test data is being used across multiple
  tests, or when you need to apply additional logic to the parameter values.
* Use the parameterize decorator when the test data is only being used for that
  specific test.
