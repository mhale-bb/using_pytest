# Testing with pytest

`pytest` is at least two things:

* `pytest` is a test runner. It gathers up all of the tests in your project and
  executes them, then presents the results.
* `pytest` is a Python module. It provides an interface that you can use in
  your tests to improve their design.

The `pytest` test runner can be used to execute tests that aren't written with
any `pytest` module functionality, such as tests that use the `unittest` module
from the standard library.
