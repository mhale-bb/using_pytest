# Exceptions

While we've tested the happy paths, we also want to test for exceptions.
`pytest` provides a simple way to test that an exception was raised:
`pytest.raises()`. If the specified exception is raised, the test passes; if it
_isn't_ raised, the test _fails_.

For example:

```python
import pytest

def test_foo():
    x = {'key': 'val'}
    with pytest.raises(KeyError): # This test will pass
        _ = x['DNE']

def test_foo2():
    x = {'key': 'val'}
    with pytest.raises(KeyError): # This test will fail
        _ = x['key']
```
