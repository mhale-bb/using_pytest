# Using pytest to write effective software tests

This presentation provides an overview of the concepts exposed by the pytest
module alongside a guided tour that implements those concepts in test code.

All of the "slides" and source code can be found in the linked repository, and
there's a branch for each presentation session so you can go back and read the
diffs after the fact.

To follow along "live," you can fork this repository and run the initialization
script at the top of the directory.
